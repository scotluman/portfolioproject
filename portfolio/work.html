			<h2>Little Way Messengers</h2>
			<p>Little Way Messengers is a non-profit organization who needed a refreshed website that better conveyed their mission. My role in this project included content structure, design, copy-writing, and launch. With a big vision and a limited budget, the best solution was to utilize a pre-built template and customize the content and CSS to ensure that the site looked fresh and original.</p>

			<h2>North Metro Church</h2>
			<p>North Metro is a thriving community in Kennesaw Georgia that needed a website that could grow alongside them and have a user-friendly backend that would allow the staff and volunteers to easily create their own content while maintaining the site's continuity. My role in this project included photo selection, copy-writing, template QA, user backend training, and launch.</p>

			<h2>Cliff's Fire Extinguihser Company</h2>
			<p>Cliff's is a local fire safety business that has been a staple in Georgia since the 80's. With the onslaught of national companies entering the Atlanta Area, Cliff's wanted to get a fresh and functional website which would allow customers to find them and get a quote quickly while maintaining the mom and pop feel that makes this company great. This was a breakout project for me in that I carried out all aspects of creation and launch.</p>
